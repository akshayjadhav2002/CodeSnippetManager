**Project: Code Snippet Manager**

A dynamic and interactive code snippet manager developed using Python and Tkinter. This application serves as a comprehensive platform for managing, running, and documenting code snippets.

**Key Features:**
- **Code Execution:** Integrated functionality to run user-inputted code within the application, providing real-time output in a dedicated window.
- **Comment Extraction:** Implemented a feature to extract comments from the user's code, aiding in the automatic generation of documentation.
- **Documentation Display:** Designed a separate section within the application to display the extracted comments, enhancing readability and understanding of the code snippets.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Tkinter

This project demonstrates my ability to create user-friendly applications with Python and Tkinter, and my understanding of code documentation and execution.
